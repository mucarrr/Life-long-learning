    founderParagraphs: [
      "At the heart of Lifelong Guidance GR lies a simple yet powerful belief: every individual has strengths that can be nurtured, developed, and transformed into resilience.",
      "Throughout my professional journey as a Speech and Language Pathologist with a professional background in educational psychological counselling, I have worked closely with children, adolescents, families, and educational communities navigating change, transition, and uncertainty—often in multicultural and international contexts. These experiences have shown me that true growth happens when individuals feel heard, understood, and supported.",
      "Lifelong Guidance GR was founded to create a space where learning, emotional wellbeing, and personal development come together. Our work is grounded in evidence-based practices, person-centred values, and a strong belief in emotional intelligence, resilience, and 21st-century skills as foundations for lifelong success.",
      "We support individuals not by focusing on past difficulties, but by helping them recognize their strengths, build emotional regulation skills, and develop the confidence needed to move forward. Whether through therapeutic support, educational consultancy, or European collaboration projects, our goal is to empower people to adapt, grow, and thrive in a rapidly changing world.",
      "At Lifelong Guidance GR, we believe that guidance is not a one-time intervention—it is a lifelong process. It is a journey built on respect, connection, and the belief that positive change is always possible.",
